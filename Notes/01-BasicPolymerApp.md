# Building a Basic Polymer 2.0 App


## 1. Introduction 

This is a walkthrough of the [_Build and Deploy a Polymer 2.0 App From Scratch_](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/whose-flag/index.html) Codelab

Note that while we are using Polymer (library to build web components, with a little "extra" synctatic sugar & helpers) - you should be able to build custom elements without it, by using the vanilla API methods.

Once created, you should be able to use custom elements anywhere just like regular HTML tags. But can you? How "WC-ready" are the various front-end frameworks? The [Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) site tracks compliance. Learn more from Rob Dodson's talk at Polymer Summit 2017. [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/robdodson/custom-elements-everywhere). [Video]()

> What you build

A simple flag-guessing game. Present a flag to the user. Give them two choices for an answer. They pick one and you tell them if they are right or wrong. Plus, a button that let's them go another round.

> What you learn

 * Setup development environment for Polymer
 * Generate app from a Polymer (starter) template
 * Add pre-built Web Components to your app
 * Style app with CSS and custom properties
 * Use Polymer elements & features to 
    - load files
    - manipulate data
    - respond to user interaction

> What you need
 
 * Command-line terminal (MacOS check!)
 * Simple text editor (Sublime3 check!)
 * Latest version of Chrome (optimal WC support)

> The target audience

Targeted at absolute beginners to web components. However basic web development knowledge is expected (HTML, CSS, JS). And basic object-oriented programming knowledge is expected (classes, encapsulation, etc). 

## 2. Getting Setup

Verify you have Node/NPM installed, else [install from site](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```
$ node -v
v8.9.4
$ npm -v
5.6.0
```

Install Bower and Polymer CLI. Verify installs were successful by checking versions.

```
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower -v
1.8.2

$ npm install -g polymer-cli
$ polymer --version
1.5.7
```

**Note:**
I encountered [this issue](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/issues/836) on my Mac, and used the ```sudo npm install -g polymer-cli --unsafe-perm``` solution proposed there, to get around the problem.

Also _bower_ is [being replaced by _yarn_ as the package manager in Polymer 3.0.](https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2017-08-23-hands-on-30-preview) (currently in early preview) so expect future codelabs/process to change.


## 3. Create a Polymer App from template

First create a new directory, then run commands within it.

```
$ mkdir whose-flag
$ cd whose-flag/
$ polymer init

? Which starter template would you like to use? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ polymer-2-element - A simple Polymer 2.0 element template 
  polymer-2-application - A simple Polymer 2.0 application 
  polymer-2-starter-kit - A Polymer 2.x starter application template, with navigation and "PRPL pattern
" loading 
  shop - The "Shop" Progressive Web App demo 
```

Select _polymer-2-application_ as the template, provide some description ("flag-guessing game") and confirm. 

```
? Which starter template would you like to use? polymer-2-application
info:    Running template polymer-2-application...
? Application name whose-flag
? Main element name whose-flag-app
? Brief description of the application Flag-Guessing Game
   create bower.json
   create index.html
   create manifest.json
   create polymer.json
   create README.md
   create src/whose-flag-app/whose-flag-app.html
   create test/whose-flag-app/whose-flag-app_test.html

Project generated!
Installing dependencies...
...
..

Setup Complete!
Check out your new project README for information about what to do next.
```

The resulting directory will look as follows:

```
README.md          - default documentation for app
bower_components/  - package dependencies    
manifest.json      - app metadata, useful for PWA
src/               - app's HTML/CSS/JS code
bower.json         - app's package dependency config
index.html         - app's entry point
polymer.json       - app's project structure, build config
test/              - app's automated tests

```

Currently, the app is defined in a single file at _src/whose-flag-app.html_. The code looks as follows:

```
<link rel="import" 
 href="../../bower_components/polymer/polymer-element.html">

<dom-module id="whose-flag-app">

  <template>
    <style>
      :host {
        display: block;
      }
    </style>
    <h2>Hello [[prop1]]!</h2>
  </template>

  <script>

    /**
     * @customElement
     * @polymer
     */
    class WhoseFlagApp extends Polymer.Element {
      static get is() { return 'whose-flag-app'; }
      static get properties() {
        return {
          prop1: {
            type: String,
            value: 'whose-flag-app'
          }
        };
      }
    }

    window.customElements.define(WhoseFlagApp.is, WhoseFlagApp);
  </script>

</dom-module>

```

Let's break it down.

 1. The [**dom-module**](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/api/elements/Polymer.DomModule) is a custom element itself. 
    - It provides a registry of _relocatable_DOM content by "id" that is agnostic to bundling. 
    - By registering the enclosed dom against the specified id, it makes that accessible later via its static _import_ API, regardless of where the content/file was relocated during the bundling. 
 
 2. The [**template**](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/dom-template) element provides a way for you to create a DOM subtree for your element. 
    - The **template** block is where we define the visual elements (user interface) of the page, ideally by composing other elements. _(HTML)_
    - The **style** block defines "look and feel" of the interface. _(CSS)_

 3. The **script** block contains code that defines your app & provides its functionality or behavior (e.g., handling interactions). _(JS)_.
    - prop1 is a [**property**](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/properties) that is declared in the class definition for the associated custom element (_WhoseFlagApp_). 
    - Properties provide state for the element, enable 2-way [data binding](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/data-binding) (using double-backet ```[[propname]] ``` syntax) and can [mapped/reflected](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/properties#property-name-mapping) to element attributes.

## 4. Serve the app

You can test your app locally using ```polymer serve ``` and manually opening the browser to the specified URL. Alternatively use ```polymer serve --open``` to auto-launch browser to the app page.

Note: this does auto-rebuild the app as you make changes to source. However it does _not_ seem to do hot reloads; rather, you need to manually refresh the browser to see the updated app.

## 5. Create the User Interface with existing Web Components

The advantage of web components is that you can not only _create_ custom elements, but you can _import and reuse_ custom elements created by others. [WebComponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/) is a central repository where both third-party-developed and Polymer-team-developed custom elements can be found (with demos and documentation).

Process to install/use these components:
 * ```cd``` to the root folder of your app
 * ```bower install <name> --save``` where name is replaced by the appropirate custom-element name e.g., ```bower install app-layout --save``` will install the "app-layout" component and save that dependencys to the bower.json file.
 * ```<link rel="import" href="../../bower_components/app-layout/app-layout.html"> ``` in the _whose-flag-app.html_ file to "import" that custom element's definition into the current app.
 * Now go ahead and _use_ that custom element in the HTML file -- e.g., you can now say ```<app-header> .. </app-header>``` in the template section, to effectively include the _app-header_ dom subtree into that of the _whose-flag-app_ custom element.

Note: Some web components are not about visual HTML elements (structure) but about custom style that is reusable - e.g., see [paper-styles](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-styles) which enforces Material Design guidelines - e.g., it defines [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) for Material Design colors, making it easier to use them consistently in other custom elements that "import" this paper-style element.

## 6. Style your app

For our element, we first installed paper-styles

```
bower install paper-styles --save
```

then added it to our imports as before. We then changed the default element style in our custom element as follows:

```
    <style>
      :host {
        display: block;
        font-family: Roboto, Noto, sans-serif;
      }
      paper-button {
        color: white;
      }
      paper-button.another {
        background: var(--paper-blue-500);
        width: 100%;
      }
      paper-button.another:hover {
        background: var(--paper-light-blue-500);
      }
      paper-button.answer {
        background: var(--paper-purple-500);
        flex-grow: 1;
      }
      paper-button.answer:hover {
        background: var(--paper-pink-500);
      }
      app-toolbar {
        background-color: var(--paper-blue-500);
        color: white;
        margin: 20px 0;
      }
      iron-image {
        border: solid;
        width: 100%;
        --iron-image-width: 100%;
         background-color: white;
      }
      #flag-image-container {
        max-width: 600px;
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
      #answer-button-container {
        display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content:space-around;
      }
    </style>
```

The ```<style>``` within the element template is _scoped locally_ - meaning those styles are enforced only on that element. The rest of the page does not know about it - this is the encapsulation that shadow DOM enables.

However, the ```:host``` selector allows you to pierce this constraint and enforce styles at the _parent_ element, enabling a consistent look & feel app-wide.

## 7. Setup data bindings

Currently all data is provided as literals (fixed strings). In reality, we want these to be variable whose values are set based on the current state of th application (i.e., current flag shown should influence labels on option buttons) or based on user input (i.e., the underlying message should reflect a 'success' or 'failure' text based on the choice made)

This is done by data binding.

The element defines properties (within the Class declaration) that are then "bound" to templated variables using the ```[[ propName ]]``` syntax. The property ideally has a default value set at creation, which is now bound to the element shown in the interface.

1-way data binding now means that any change to the property value (in the JavaScript code) will automatically be reflected in a change to the value of
the bound template variable.

The property value changes are typically done by methods invoked in response to some internal or external action - e.g., a button click handler can now be used to change the "message" property, which is used to provide the status message.

So now we can change

```
<paper-button id="optionA">Brazil</paper-button>
<paper-button id="optionB">Uruguay</paper-button>
```

to 

```
<paper-button id="optionA">[[countryA]]</paper-button>
<paper-button id="optionB">[[countryB]]</paper-button>
```

and also updated with click handlers

```
<paper-button id="optionA" class="answer" 
       on-click="_selectAnswer">[[countryA]]</paper-button>
<paper-button id="optionB" class="answer" 
       on-click="_selectAnswer">[[countryB]]</paper-button>
  .
  .
<p> [[outputMessage]] </p>
```


where these template variables are bound to properties in the app class, which have initial default provided:

```
static get properties() {
        return {
          countryA: {
            type: String,
            value: "Brazil"
          },
          countryB: {
            type: String,
            value: "Uruguay"
          },
          outputMessage: {
            type: String,
            value: "What's your answer?"
          },
          correctAnswer: {
            type: String,
            value: "Brazil"
          }, 
          userAnswer: {
            type: String,
            value: "Brazil"
          }
        };
```

And the property values can now be updated by class methods (e.g., click event handlers), automatically updating bound variables in the process.

```
_selectAnswer(event) {
    let clickedButton = event.target;
    this.userAnswer = clickedButton.textContent;
    if (this.userAnswer == this.correctAnswer) {
      this.outputMessage = `${this.userAnswer} is correct!`;
    }
    else {
      this.outputMessage = `Nope! The correct answer is ${this.correctAnswer} !`;
    }
}
```

_Note:_ The "on-click=''" attribute is a Polymer-specific "synctatic sugar" approach to simplifying association of event handler callback methods with elements.

## 8. Load Country Data from a file

Next, we want to stamp out templates for each flag - which means we need data for all the flags we plan to use. The data in step 5 also contains a _countrycodes.json_ file with a mapping of country codes and names, along with an SVG file that contains flag images correspondingly named by country code.

1. Load the file using the [```<iron-ajax>```](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/iron-ajax) element, which allows network request functionality using this API:
```
<iron-ajax
    auto
    url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search"
    params='{"part":"snippet", "q":"polymer", "key": "YOUTUBE_API_KEY", "type": "video"}'
    handle-as="json"
    on-response="handleResponse"
    debounce-duration="300"></iron-ajax>
```

Install the element using bower, import it into the app HTML file, then add it into the template as follows:

```
<iron-ajax
  auto
  url="data/countrycodes.json"
  handle-as="json"
  on-response="_handleResponse"></iron-ajax>
```

This effectively fetches the data in the specified url, treats that data as JSON, calls the specified on-response handler with the data once the fetch completes. The "auto" simply ensures that this element automatically re-fetches data (and invokes handler) every time that URL or parameters change.

```
_handleResponse(event) {
    this.countryList = event.detail.response.countrycodes;
    this.countryA = this.countryList[0];
    this.countryB = this.countryList[1];
    this.correctAnswer = this.countryA;
}
```

The handler code places the fetched data into a local property (array) and updates the related countryA & countryB properties to point to elements of this data (which are now in object form, not strings)

So make sure countryA, countryB property definitions are changed, and their usage is updated e.g., use ```[[countryA.name]]``` not ```[[countryA]]``` to reflect the new status as objects. Now all other hard-coded strings (e.g., svg images) can now be bound to property names as well.

```
<iron-image
    id="flag-image"
    preload fade src="data/svg/BR.svg">
</iron-image>

BECOMES

<iron-image
    id="flag-image"
    preload fade src="data/svg/[[correctAnswer.code]].svg">
</iron-image>
```


## 9. Randomize the country options

Make this a proper game by adding a function to randomly pick a country from the countryList. 

```
__getRandomCountry() {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (this.countryList.length));
}
```

Then use the random picker to initialize the countryA and countryB properties, making sure they are both unique (but random) values.

```
while (!this.countryA || !this.countryB || (this.countryA.code == this.countryB.code)){
  this.countryA = this.countryList[this.__getRandomCountry()];
  this.countryB = this.countryList[this.__getRandomCountry()];
}
```

And flip a coin to pick which one of those two will be the "correct" answer.

```
let coin = (Math.floor(Math.random() * 2));
this.correctAnswer = coin == 1 ? this.countryA : this.countryB;
```

Finally fix the "Another Game" button response by defining an on-click handler that simply restarts the game.

```
// In template
<paper-button class="another" id="another" 
    on-click="_restart">Another!</paper-button> 

// In class
_restart() {
    window.location.reload();
}
```

This completes the app creation.

## 10. Build app for production / Deploy to Firebase
